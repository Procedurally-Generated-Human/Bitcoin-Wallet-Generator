# Bitcoin-Wallet-Generator
Bitcoin wallet generator made with flask.   
# Features:   
- Generates private keys based on entered text instead of computer-generated random bits.  
- Also generates QR-codes for both address and private key.  
- The generated wallets can be easily printed by using the "Print" button.  
     
NOTE: This program was made to generate wallets on a LOCAL SERVER, hence it generates wallets in the backend, therefor it is not recommended to be used on the internet (pure JavaScript generators are recommended for that task).
